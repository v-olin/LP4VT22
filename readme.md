# Study period 4, 21/22
Lecture notes, course documents and more for LP4 in TKDAT-2

## Lecture notes
Notes are written in markdown in VSC.

If you want to read them properly, here are the VSC extensions I use:

- General Markdown: [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
- Renderer: [Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)
- Math: [Markdown+Math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath)
